see if I can add a sidebar for the docs dir via https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63410862/sidebar-on-github-pages

this would allow wiki-like navigation without all the difficulties of using the GitHub wiki


Side Nav

- Quickstart

- Additional State Machine Features
- Using the Simulator
- How to Test State Machines
- Integrating with Other Platforms

- Advanced StateSmith Usage
  - Customizing StateSmith
  - 
  - 

- Examples (link to examples directory, don't list each individually)
