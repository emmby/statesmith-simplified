# StateSmith
StateSmith is a cross platform, free/open source tool for synchronizing state machine diagrams to multiple programming languages. The generated code is human readable, has zero dependencies and is suitable for use with tiny bare metal microcontrollers, video games, apps, web, computers... It avoids dynamic memory allocations for the safety or performance inclined.

With StateSmith, your state machine diagram is code. Never worry about keeping your statemachine documentation in sync with your code again.

# Why Use StateSmith?

If you are new to state machines, then prepare to level up your toolbox! They are incredibly helpful for [certain applications](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/wiki/App-Notes).

I couldn't find a quality state machine code generator that met my needs, had an attractive license, and was enjoyable to use.

StateSmith has a strong suite of tests (730+) and behavior specification coverage. The specification integration tests read a diagram file, generate executable state machine code, then compile and execute that code in another process and ensure that the state machine behavior is exactly what was expected. The same suite of integration tests run for each supported programming language. StateSmith has been starred the most of any state machine library on Github, and is in production use by several companies.


## The Diagram is Always Accurate! ðŸ“š
Before I created StateSmith, it was always a pain trying to manually synchronize a hand written state machine with a drawing. Urgent client requests come in and you update the code, but do you and your team always remember to update the drawing? Probably not and so the rot begins. Documentation trust issues arise and as designs get larger, the effort to ensure the diagram is accurate starts to become quite punishing.

Now that we use StateSmith at my work, I never have to worry about the above. I love generating fully working code **from** the documentation. Incredibly helpful for teams and communicating with clients.
