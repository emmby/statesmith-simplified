## Displaying Diagrams using Mermaid

GitHub Markdown has native support for Mermaid. Mermaid's Flowchart diagrams offer a close approximation 
to state diagrams and can represent many or most of what you might want to achieve in your state machines.

```mermaid
Off -- Switch pressed --> On
On -- Switch pressed --> Off
```
These diagrams will display properly in your README.md and other markdown files when viewed on GitHub.

#### GitHub Pages

By default, GitHub Pages do not natively display Mermaid diagrams. But you can customize the template
used to generate your pages to add Mermaid rendering.
